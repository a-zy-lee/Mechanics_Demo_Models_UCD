The Brachistochrone model contains 2 assemblies: curved paths and a cycloid drawer.

All parts were designed for CNC milling. The "starter" was designed such that it should be cut from 2mm 3003 aluminium and bent 90Â° with a 2mm bend radius.

The curved paths are made of individual layers that are connected by 5 countersunk screws that sit flush against the back layer. 
The front layer should face the 'outside'. The back layer should face the cycloid drawer.

The dimensions of the rail above the rack must be adjusted accordingly if different rollers are used. The rollers from RS-Online linked in PartsList-V2.xlsx are the correct dimensions.

A circular sticker (100mm diameter) should be stuck onto the "wheel". This sticker should depict a wheel with a red dot on its outer edge.

Refer to cycloid_alignment.png for alignment. The cycloid transparent sticker should be placed on the glass and aligned with 2 things:
1. Dot on the sticker of the wheel, such that the marker is vertical and to the right, at the top of the cycloid.
2. The path of the cycloid on the Brachistochrone curved paths.

The objective of this alignment is for the red dot on the wheel to trace the cycloid (and Brachistochrone) when the trolley is moved from the right to the left. The pitch diameter of the gear that drives the wheel is equal to the characteristic diameter of the cycloid of the Brachistochrone.

The sticker file is BRN-21-transparentcycloidsticker-10.16cm.png and should be printed 10.16cm in height for correct scaling.
