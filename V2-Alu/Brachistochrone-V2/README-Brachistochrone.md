The Brachistochrone model contains 2 assemblies: curved paths and a cycloid drawer.

All parts were designed for CNC milling. The "starter" was designed such that it should be cut from 2mm 3003 aluminium and bent 90Â° with a 2mm bend radius.

The curved paths are made of individual layers that are connected by 5 countersunk screws that sit flush against the back layer. 
The front layer should face the 'outside'. The back layer should face the cycloid drawer.

The cycloid transparent sticker should be placed on the glass and aligned with 2 things:
1. Marker on the print on the circle, such that the marker is vertical and to the right, at the top of the cycloid.
2. The path of the cycloid on the Brachistochrone curved paths.

The dimensions of the rack must be adjusted accordingly if different rollers are used.
