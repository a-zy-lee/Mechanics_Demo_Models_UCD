This model includes 2 double pendulums that are set up side by side such that the attendee can start them off in the same starting positions.

Bearings, washers, shafts and plastic sheeting are required, per the parts list. 

The plastic sheeting is screwed to the mount to prevent attendees from sticking fingers through the holes which can lead to injury.
