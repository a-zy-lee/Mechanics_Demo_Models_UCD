The galton board require a custom silicon gasket to be made for the purpose of waterproofing.
This can be laser cut from a silicon/rubber gasket sheet.
Gasketed M4 point fixings are required to secure the front glass to the board with a waterproof seal.

The Galton Board sits on 2 hinges, each made from a ~17mm long 8mm diameter shaft, which is connected to ball bearings on each end.
