# Mechanics_Demo_Models_UCD
These models demonstrate mechanical concepts for a fun walk in UCD.
This work was done by Aidan Lee for the School of Mechanical and Materials Engineering, UCD.

This repository contains the model designs. Here, you will find:
1. A parts list.
2. Accompanying informational graphics.
3. CAD files for each part and the assembly of each model. The CAD files are included as both STP and the original IPT file. The IPT files can only be opened by Autodesk Inventor 2019 or newer.
