	abstract = {In this study we explored whether the use of teachers' demonstrations significantly improves studentsâ€™ understanding of redox reactions compared with control group counterparts who were not exposed to the demonstrations. The sample consisted of 131 Israeli 8th graders in middle schools (junior high school). Students' attitudes and achievements as well as their understanding of redox and electrolysis were assessed by administering a questionnaire that investigated their attitudes (perceptions) towards a demonstration in chemistry. The findings showed that the experimental group's achievements and understanding of the subject were statistically significantly better than those of their control group counterparts.},

	abstract = {Recent attention has been brought to light in the United States regarding low numbers of students pursing STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math) disciplines and degree programs (National Science Board, 2010). There is a great need in America for talented scientists and engineers.
Numerous programs abound for high school and middle school students in regard to STEM initiatives; however, fewer opportunities exist for elementary students and their teachers. Research has shown that early exposure to STEM initiatives and activities positively impacts elementary students'
perceptions and dispositions (Bagiati, Yoon, Evangelou, \& Ngambeki, 2010; Bybee, \& Fuchs, 2006). By capturing students' interest in STEM content at an earlier age, a proactive approach can ensure that students are on track through middle and high school to complete the needed coursework
for adequate preparation to enter STEM degree programs at institutions of higher learning. As a result, programs focusing on STEM initiatives and content are a growing priority in American schools with aims to provide early exposure for elementary students.},
