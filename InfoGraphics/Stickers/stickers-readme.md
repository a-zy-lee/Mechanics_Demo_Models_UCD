These stickers can be printed onto a laminated vinyl sticker. A clear coat of finishing should be applied over the top for additional weather proofing. "Mod Podge" is suitable for this purpose.

Alternatively, the stickers can be printed onto corriboard, which is considerably thicker. The corriboard can be screwed to the platform.
