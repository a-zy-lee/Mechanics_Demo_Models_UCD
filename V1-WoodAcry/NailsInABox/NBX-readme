The only custom part needed for this model is the platform.
The model uses an IP67 electronics enclosure with a clear cover. This model readily comes in 170x220x110 mm dimensions.
A zip tie should be used to keep this box sealed shut.
Stainless steel lost head nails should be used.

The box should be chained down. This can be done with a bracket and sink plug chain with a screw.
